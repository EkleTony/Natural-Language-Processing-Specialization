In Course 2 of the Natural Language Processing Specialization, offered by deeplearning.ai, you will:

* Create a simple auto-correct algorithm using minimum edit distance and dynamic programming,
* Apply the Viterbi Algorithm for part-of-speech (POS) tagging, which is important for computational linguistics,
* Write a better auto-complete algorithm using an N-gram language model, and 
* Write your own Word2Vec model that uses a neural network to compute word embeddings using a continuous bag-of-words model.
