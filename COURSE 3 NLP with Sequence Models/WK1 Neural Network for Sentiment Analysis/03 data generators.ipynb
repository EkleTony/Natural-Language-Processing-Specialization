    "### Exercise\n",
    "\n",
    "**Instructions:** Implement a data generator function that takes in `batch_size, x, y shuffle` where x could be a large list of samples, and y is a list of the tags associated with those samples. Return a subset of those inputs in a tuple of two arrays `(X,Y)`. Each is an array of dimension (`batch_size`). If `shuffle=True`, the data will be traversed in a random form.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Details:**\n",
    "\n",
    "This code as an outer loop  \n",
    "```\n",
    "while True:  \n",
    "...  \n",
    "yield((X,Y))  \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Which runs continuously in the fashion of generators, pausing when yielding the next values. We will generate a batch_size output on each pass of this loop.    \n",
    "\n",
    "It has an inner loop that stores in temporal lists (X, Y) the data samples to be included in the next batch.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are three slightly out of the ordinary features. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. The first is the use of a list of a predefined size to store the data for each batch. Using a predefined size list reduces the computation time if the elements in the array are of a fixed size, like numbers. If the elements are of different sizes, it is better to use an empty array and append one element at a time during the loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The second is tracking the current location in the incoming lists of samples. Generators variables hold their values between invocations, so we create an `index` variable, initialize to zero, and increment by one for each sample included in a batch. However, we do not use the `index` to access the positions of the list of sentences directly. Instead, we use it to select one index from a list of indexes. In this way, we can change the order in which we traverse our original list, keeping untouched our original list.  \n",
    "\n",
    "3. The third also relates to wrapping. Because `batch_size` and the length of the input lists are not aligned, gathering a batch_size group of inputs may involve wrapping back to the beginning of the input loop. In our approach, it is just enough to reset the `index` to 0. We can re-shuffle the list of indexes to produce different batches each time."
