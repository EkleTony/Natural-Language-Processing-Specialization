## In Course 3 of the Natural Language Processing Specialization, you will:

  a. Train a neural network with GLoVe word embeddings to perform sentiment analysis of tweets,
  b. Generate synthetic Shakespeare text using a Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) language model,
  c. Train a recurrent neural network to perform named entity recognition (NER) using LSTMs with linear layers, and 
  d. Use so-called ‘Siamese’ LSTM models to compare questions in a corpus and identify those that are worded differently but have the same meaning.


By the end of this Specialization, you will have designed NLP applications that perform question-answering and sentiment analysis, created tools to translate languages and summarize text, and even built a chatbot!
