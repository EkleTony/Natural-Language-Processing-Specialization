In Course 1 of the Natural Language Processing Specialization, offered by deeplearning.ai, you will:   

* Perform sentiment analysis of tweets using logistic regression and then naïve Bayes, 
* Use vector space models to discover relationships between words and use PCA to reduce the dimensionality of the vector space and visualize those relationships, and
* Write a simple English to French translation algorithm using pre-computed word embeddings and locality sensitive hashing to relate words via approximate k-nearest neighbor search.   
    
Please make sure that you’re comfortable programming in Python and have a basic knowledge of machine learning, matrix multiplications, and conditional probability.
